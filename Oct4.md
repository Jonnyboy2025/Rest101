# Christianity In India
## Thomas to Kerala
### Questions and Concerns
- Identity: How do different ways folks understand the identity of "Christian" get used, and by whom?
- Categories: How do the ways "Christian" gets categorized affect the narratives?
- Authority: Who gets to decide? and for whom?
- Question of comparison: How do such questions of categories/identities relate to our concept of "relgion", how do they ask us to challenge our concept? How do they challenge the notion of "religion" as a static category?
